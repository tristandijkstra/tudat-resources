Particulars
 
   The body ID code used in this file for the Earth is 3000; this
   number indicates that the terrestrial frame used is ITRF93.
 
   This file is a "high-precision" PCK file giving the orientation of
   the Earth as a function of time for the interval shown above.  The
   terrestrial frame is ITRF93; the inertial base frame is Ecliptic of
   J2000.  Rotational effects included are:
 
      -Precession (1976 IAU model)
      -Nutation   (1980 IAU model)
      -Rotation through true sidereal time
      -Polar motion
      -Nutation corrections
 
   Euler angles have been extracted from the Ecliptic-to-ITRF93
   rotation matrix, and Chebyshev polynomials were fit to the
   Euler angles.  The Chebyshev expansion degree was 49; the
   degree of the retained polynomials is 20.  The coverage
   interval for each set of polynomials is 1 day or less.
 
Usage
 
   This file may be used for applications requiring earth orientation
   accuracy of several microradians.
 
   Note that high accuracy transformation of station locations
   from terrestrial to inertial reference frames requires
   accounting for motion of the station relative to the terrestrial
   reference frame; such motion is not reflected by the rotation
   data in this file.
